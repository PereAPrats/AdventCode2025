"""
This is the fourth challenge of Advent Code 2025.
"""
"""
Part 1:
You need to help the Elves optimize the work of the forklifts in the 
printing department so they can free up time to break through a wall 
and reach the cafeteria. The department has a large grid representing 
the positions of paper rolls (@). A forklift can only access a roll 
if there are fewer than four rolls in the eight adjacent positions 
(orthogonal and diagonal). Your task is to analyze the grid and 
determine how many rolls of paper are accessible under this rule.
